### Machine Learning Engineer | M.Sc. in AI @ ITA

> "I Would Spend 55 Minutes Defining the Problem and then Five Minutes Solving It" - Albert Einstein

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and former Air Force fighter pilot, leveraging a unique background in mission-critical operations to build robust and impactful AI solutions. My experience leading teams and solving complex challenges in the military has honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

Currently, I am pursuing a **Master's degree in AI/Deep Learning at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA)**, one of Brazil's most prestigious engineering institutions. My research is focused on applying Computer Vision to satellite imagery for the detection of illegal mining, combining my passion for technology and mission-driven problem-solving.
